I created a Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (In Python)

import random

options = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
winning_combinations = [("rock", "scissors"), ("paper", "rock"), ("scissors", "paper")]

while True:
    in_shoot = input("Play! Choose rock, paper, or scissors? ").lower()
    if in_shoot not in options:
        print("Enter a valid choice!")
    else:
        shoot = random.choice(options)
        print("You chose:", in_shoot)
        print("I chose:", shoot)

        if in_shoot == shoot:
            print("It's a tie!")
        elif (in_shoot, shoot) in winning_combinations:
            print("You win, not like it means anything!")
        else:
            print("You lose, and you probably will again!")

        play_again = input("Do you want to play again, chicken? (yes/no) ").lower()
        if play_again != "yes":
            break
